Bear woke up in the morning. The sun was bright. His nose twitched. He smelled something sweet. Honey! His favorite.

Bear lumbered out of his den. The forest was green. Birds sang. Flowers bloomed. Bear walked slowly. He looked everywhere.

He saw a big tree. Its trunk was thick. Bear climbed. The branches swayed. He reached higher. His paws were strong.

Then—he saw it! A little bee flew by. Then another. A buzzing sound filled the air. Bear smiled. The honey was close. His tummy rumbled.

He found a hollow in the tree. It was full of golden liquid. Bear licked his lips. He dipped his paw in. The honey was warm. Sweet. So good.

But then—oh no! A bee stung his nose. Bear sneezed. The honey splashed everywhere. He looked down. His paw was sticky. His fur was messy.

Bear sighed. He wiped his nose. Maybe he should wait. The bees were busy. They might leave soon.

He sat under the tree. The sun warmed him. A little bird landed on his shoulder. "Hello," Bear said softly. The bird chirped.

Bear watched the bees. They flew in and out. The honey stayed quiet. He waited. His paw was still sticky. His tummy still wanted honey.

Then—he had an idea. Bear went to a nearby stream. He dipped his paw in the water. He scrubbed his fur. The stickiness went away.

He climbed the tree again. The bees were still busy. Bear took a deep breath. He reached for the honey. This time, he was gentle.

The bees flew away. Bear took a big sip. The honey was still sweet. He closed his eyes. It was perfect.

The little bird chirped again. Bear smiled. "Thank you," he said. The bird flew away happy.

Bear sat under the tree. The forest was quiet. His belly was full. He was happy. The sun shone warm. Everything was just right.
