Liam liked to sit by the pond. The water was calm. Birds floated on it. He loved to watch them.

One day, he brought his small book. He sat on the big rock. The sun was warm. Birds sang softly.

Liam saw a duck. One duck. He said, "One duck. One duck." He wrote it down. The duck swam away.

Another duck came. Liam looked. He said, "One duck. Now two ducks." He wrote again. The ducks swam together.

More ducks came. They quacked happily. Liam counted them one by one. "Three ducks. Four ducks. Five ducks." His little hands moved fast on the page.

A big duck came last. It was different. Its feathers were gray and white. Liam smiled. He said, "One, two, three, four, five, six." His heart felt happy.

The ducks played in the water. Liam watched them. He counted again. "Six ducks. Six ducks." He closed his book and laughed.

A lady sat near him. She smiled. "You like ducks, don’t you?" Liam nodded. "Yes," he said. "I like ducks very much."

She took out a cracker. She gave it to the ducks. They came close. They pecked at it. Liam clapped his hands. "Look! They like crackers too!"

He counted again. "One, two, three, four, five, six." The lady laughed. "They’re still six, even with crackers."

Liam stayed by the pond. He counted ducks every day. The water stayed calm. The birds stayed happy. And Liam was always content.
