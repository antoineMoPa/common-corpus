The rain came down soft and slow. Tiny drops hit the ground. They made puddles here and there. The sky was gray. The world looked wet.

Liam stood at the door. He saw the puddles. He smiled. He wanted to jump. The rain felt nice on his face.

"Come on," he said. His sister, Mia, looked up. She saw the puddles too. She giggled. "Let's go!"

They ran outside. The rain was still soft. The ground was slippery. Liam wiggled his toes in the mud. It was cool and squishy.

"Watch this," Liam said. He took a big step. He jumped right in. The water splashed up. It hit his knees. He laughed. The rain kept falling.

Mia watched. She took a deep breath. She stepped in. The water was cold. She jumped too. "Again!" she said.

They jumped in puddle after puddle. The water was deep in some. It was just a splash in others. They laughed and giggled. The rain made their hair wet. Their clothes stuck to them.

A big puddle was near the fence. It was deep and dark. Liam looked at it. He took a deep breath. He jumped in. The water was cold. He splashed hard. Mia laughed so hard she almost fell.

They played for a long time. The rain kept falling. The puddles kept growing. They were happy. The rain was their friend today.

When they were tired, they went inside. They were wet and muddy. Their mother smiled. She saw their happy faces. She gave them towels. "You had fun, didn’t you?" she asked.

Liam and Mia nodded. They wiped their faces. They looked out the window. The rain was still falling. The puddles were still there.

"We’ll come back tomorrow," Liam said. Mia agreed. They knew the puddles would be waiting. They would jump again. The rain was always kind on rainy days.
