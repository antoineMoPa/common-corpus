Once, a little girl named Lila loved to play in the garden. She liked to look at the flowers. The flowers were red. The flowers were blue. The flowers were yellow. They were many colors.

One day, Lila saw a rainbow. It was high in the sky. It was bright and pretty. Lila ran to her father. "Look, Papa!" she said. "I see a rainbow!"

Her father smiled. "Yes, Lila. It is a rainbow. It has many colors."

Lila looked closely. She saw red first. Then orange. Then yellow. Then green. Then blue. Then purple. "Papa," she said, "it has so many colors!"

Her father knelt by her. "Yes, Lila. The rainbow has red, orange, yellow, green, blue, and purple. It is all the colors!"

Lila wanted to know more. "Are these all the colors?" she asked.

Her father took her hand. "No, my dear. There are many colors in the world. Red, orange, yellow, green, blue, purple—these are just some. Look around you. You will see more."

Lila looked at the garden again. She saw pink flowers. She saw brown leaves. She saw white daisies. "There are so many colors!" she said.

Her father hugged her. "Yes, Lila. The world is full of colors. Keep looking. Keep seeing. The colors are everywhere."

That night, Lila slept with a smile. She thought about the rainbow. She thought about all the colors. She knew the world was bright and beautiful. And she was happy.
