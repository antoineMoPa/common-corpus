Liam ran fast. The red balloon bounced ahead. It was bright. It was free. It was just out of reach.

The sun shone down. The grass was soft. Birds sang high. Liam’s shoes pounded the ground. He did not stop.

The balloon went near a big tree. A leaf fell. Liam saw it. He jumped. The balloon went up again.

A little girl laughed. She had a green balloon. It was not red. Liam looked. The red balloon was still there.

It floated near a bench. Liam sat down. He watched it. The wind blew. The balloon went higher. Liam stood up.

He ran again. His heart beat fast. The balloon was far. It was so high. Liam could not see it.

Then—there it was. The red balloon was near a fence. Liam ran. He reached. He grabbed. The string was long.

The balloon went up. Up it went. Liam pulled. The string was tight. His arms hurt. He did not let go.

The balloon stopped. It was safe. Liam smiled. His cheeks were red. His hair was wild.

The little girl clapped. "You got it!" she said. Liam hugged the string. He was happy.

The park was quiet now. The sun was warm. The red balloon stayed still. Liam knew one thing.

Next time, he would chase it again.
