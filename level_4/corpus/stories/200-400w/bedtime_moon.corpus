The moon peeked over the hill. It was soft and round. The sky was dark blue.

"Goodnight, little fox," the moon said. The fox was curled up in the grass. Its tail twitched. "Sleep well," the moon whispered.

A bunny hopped by. Its ears were tall. "Goodnight, bunny," the moon sang. The bunny blinked. "Thank you," it said softly.

A bird flew past. Its feathers were black. "Goodnight, little bird," the moon called. The bird landed on a branch. "Goodnight," it chirped back.

The stars twinkled. They were little lights in the sky. "Goodnight, stars," the moon said. The stars shimmered. "Goodnight to you too," they replied.

A rabbit nibbled on grass. Its eyes were bright. "Goodnight, rabbit," the moon murmured. The rabbit looked up. "Goodnight," it said sleepily.

A cat stretched in the moonlight. Its fur was warm. "Goodnight, kitty," the moon cooed. The cat purred. "Goodnight," it mewed.

The wind blew gently. It carried the moon’s voice far. "Goodnight, all my friends," the moon said. The animals closed their eyes.

The moon smiled down. It was happy. The world was quiet. The moon knew they were safe.

"Sleep tight," the moon whispered. The animals dreamed. The moon watched over them. Night was kind.
