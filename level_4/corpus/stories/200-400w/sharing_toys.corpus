Liam had a red truck. It was his favorite. He loved it very much. Every day, he played with his truck. He pushed it up hills. He made it go fast. He never shared it.

One day, his friend, Max, came to play. Max had a blue car. Max wanted to play with Liam’s truck. Max said, "Can I have a turn?"

Liam looked at his truck. He held it tight. He said, "No. It’s mine."

Max looked sad. He sat down. He did not play with his car. He just watched Liam.

Liam saw Max’s sad face. He thought, "Maybe I should share." He took a deep breath. He said, "Okay, Max. You can have a turn."

Max’s face lit up. He clapped his hands. "Thank you, Liam!"

They took turns with the truck. Liam drove it first. Then Max did. Liam pushed the truck up hills. Max made it go fast. They both laughed and smiled.

After a while, Liam said, "I want to play with your car now."

Max smiled. He said, "Yes! You can have a turn."

They played together. They shared their toys. They had a happy time. Liam and Max learned something important. Sharing makes playtime better. It makes friends happier.

From that day on, they always shared. They took turns with their toys. They played and laughed together. Their friendship grew stronger. Sharing made everything nice.
