One cold morning, a little girl named Mia walked to school. The air was crisp, and the leaves crunched under her feet. She loved walking to school alone. She liked watching the world go by.

Then she saw something small. It was a tiny, scared kitten. Its fur was soft and gray. It shivered in the cold. Mia’s heart went out to it. She knelt down. "Oh, little one," she whispered. "You are lost."

The kitten looked up at her with big, round eyes. Its paws were cold. Mia scooped it up gently. "Don’t worry," she said. "I’ll help you."

She held the kitten close. It purred softly, feeling safe. Mia walked slowly, looking for a home. She saw a house with a yellow door. A woman stood on the porch. She had a basket of fruit.

Mia stopped. "Excuse me," she said. "I think this kitten is lost." She held the kitten out.

The woman smiled. "Oh, thank you, dear." She took the kitten. "This is my neighbor’s cat, Whiskers. She’s been missing for days."

Mia beamed. "I’m glad I found her." The kitten meowed happily. It rubbed against the woman’s legs.

The woman hugged Mia. "You’re a kind girl." She gave Mia a small treat. "For helping Whiskers."

Mia walked home, her heart full. She knew she had done something good. The kitten was safe. The world felt a little brighter.

That night, Mia snuggled under her blanket. She thought of the little gray kitten. She smiled. "I’ll always help those in need," she whispered to the stars. And she believed it.
