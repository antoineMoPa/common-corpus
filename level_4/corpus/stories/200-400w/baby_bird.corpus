Little Bird was small and soft. His feathers were fluffy and warm. He lived in a nest high up in a tree. His mother sang to him every day. She said, "Soon, my little one, you will fly."

Little Bird listened. He watched the big birds fly. They soared high in the sky. They glided on the wind. Little Bird wanted to fly too.

One morning, Little Bird felt different. His wings felt heavy. He stretched them wide. He wiggled his toes. He was ready.

"Mama," he chirped. "I want to fly!"

Mama Bird smiled. "You must try, my brave one."

Little Bird hopped to the edge of the nest. He looked down at the ground far below. His heart beat fast. He took a deep breath.

Then—he jumped.

The wind rushed past him. His wings flapped. He felt light. He felt free. But then—he wobbled. He fell. He landed softly in the grass.

Little Bird was okay. He was happy. He looked up at Mama Bird. She cheered, "You did it! You flew!"

Little Bird flapped his wings again. He tried again. This time, he stayed up longer. He soared a little. He landed gently in the grass.

Mama Bird clapped her wings. "You are learning, my little one."

Little Bird tried and tried. He fell sometimes. He landed softly. He flew a little higher each time.

One sunny afternoon, Little Bird took a big jump. His wings spread wide. The wind carried him. He did not fall. He flew!

He soared over the trees. He glided on the breeze. He was a bird now. He was free.

Mama Bird sang proudly. "You have flown, my brave little one. You are a bird now."

Little Bird chirped happily. He flew higher. He flew farther. He was home in the sky.
