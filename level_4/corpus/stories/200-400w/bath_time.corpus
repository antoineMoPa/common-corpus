Lily loved bath time. The water was warm and soft. She sat in the big tub. The tub was round and blue.

Mama put in a rubber duck. The duck was yellow and bright. Lily smiled. "Hello, duck!" she said.

The duck floated. It went up and down. It went left and right. Lily laughed. "Go, duck, go!"

Then Mama added bubbles. Big bubbles came up fast. Little bubbles popped and went. Some bubbles stuck to the duck. The duck looked like it had a white hat.

Lily reached out. She touched a bubble. It was soft and cool. "Squish!" she said.

The duck wobbled. A bubble popped on its back. "Oh!" Lily giggled.

Mama sang a song. The words were soft. "Bubble, bubble, pop, pop, pop." The song was happy.

Lily played with the duck. She made the duck spin. She made the duck dive. The bubbles danced around. They went up and down like little balloons.

A big bubble floated to the top. It was round and shiny. Lily blew on it. The bubble popped. "Pock!" it said.

Mama dried Lily’s hair. It was wet and smooth. The duck was dry now. It sat still on the tub’s edge.

Lily hugged the duck. "Thank you, duck," she whispered. The duck was her friend. Bath time was fun.

Mama smiled. "Time to get out," she said. Lily stood up. The water swirled. The bubbles were gone.

She held the duck close. It felt warm and safe. Bath time was over. But the happy memory stayed.
