The first hint of the river’s existence came on a Thursday afternoon when the rain had been relentless for three days, turning the school’s familiar corridors into a labyrinth of slick stone and the air thick with the damp, musky scent of earth and something older—something that didn’t belong in the ventilation shafts or the forgotten corners of the basement. Elias Carter, a boy with a knack for noticing things that others overlooked, had been lingering near the old biology lab, where the floorboards groaned under his weight as he pressed his ear to the warped wooden planks. The sound was faint at first, a low, rhythmic murmur like distant water lapping against stone, but it persisted, insistent, as if the earth itself were holding its breath and then exhaling in a sigh.

He should have known better than to follow it.

The others—Lila, whose sharp wit was matched only by her stubbornness, and Jace, who moved through the world with a quiet intensity that made people underestimate him—had been skeptical at first. “You’re telling me there’s a river *under* the school?” Lila had scoffed, her dark curls escaping from the loose braid she’d tied them in, her usual skepticism sharpened by the absurdity of the idea. “Last time you said there was a ghost in the janitor’s closet, remember? Turns out it was just Mr. Holloway’s old sneakers.” But Elias had pressed on, his fingers tracing the damp patches on the wall, the way the air felt cooler in certain pockets, as if something unseen were breathing down their necks. Jace, ever the pragmatist, had finally relented, though his expression remained skeptical. “Fine. But if we’re getting wet, I’m blaming you.”

The entrance was hidden behind a loose brick in the corner of the basement, where the old heating vents had long since been abandoned. The brick gave way with a groan, revealing not just air but something darker, something that pulsed with an eerie, bioluminescent glow—faint veins of light snaking along the walls like veins in some vast, sleeping creature. The moment they stepped inside, the air changed, thickened, as if the very atmosphere had been altered by something ancient and untamed. Lila’s breath hitched, her usual bravado faltering for the first time in years. “Okay, that’s not normal,” she whispered, her voice tight with something between awe and dread.

The river was wider than they’d imagined, its waters a deep, inky blue that shifted subtly, as though reflecting light from somewhere beyond their vision. The banks were lined with smooth, moss-covered stones that glowed faintly, and the water moved with an eerie silence, as if the current were holding its breath. Elias reached out, his fingers brushing the surface, and for a moment, he swore he felt a current—not of water, but of something else, something that hummed beneath the surface like the faintest vibration in a tuning fork. “It’s not just water,” he murmured, more to himself than to the others. “It’s *alive*.”

Jace, ever the rationalist, crouched down to examine the stones. “These aren’t natural,” he said, running his fingers over the smooth, almost metallic surface. “They’re too uniform. And look—” He pointed to faint symbols etched into the rock, too worn to be recent, too deliberate to be accidental. “Some kind of writing. Ancient.” Lila, never one to be outdone, knelt beside him, her sharp eyes scanning the walls. “Or not ancient,” she corrected. “More like… *forgotten*.”

The deeper they ventured, the more the river seemed to shift around them, as if responding to their presence. The air grew warmer, thick with the scent of damp earth and something metallic, like old coins or rusted iron. Then, without warning, the water parted. Not like a river would part—this was more deliberate, as if the current itself had been held back, waiting. And there, in the center of the clearing, stood a figure.

It was tall, its form draped in tattered robes that seemed to absorb the light rather than reflect it, its hands outstretched as if in welcome or warning. Its face was obscured by a hood, but the eyes—when they lifted—were unmistakable. Golden. Ancient. And knowing. “You have come,” the figure said, its voice like the slow drip of water through stone, yet somehow clear as a bell. “You have seen what was meant to remain unseen.”

Lila was the first to speak, her voice steady despite the way her pulse hammered in her throat. “Who are you?”

The figure tilted its head, the movement fluid, almost liquid. “I am the keeper of what lies beneath. And you have disturbed the balance.” Its gaze flickered to Elias, then to Jace, then back to Lila, as if measuring something. “You are not the first to seek this place. But you are the first to *need* it.”

Elias stepped forward, his mind racing. “We didn’t come here to steal. We just—we wanted to know what was down here.” The words felt inadequate, but he couldn’t think of anything else to say.

The figure chuckled, a sound like stones shifting beneath a glacier. “Knowledge is a dangerous thing, child. But curiosity is a virtue.” It reached into its robes and withdrew a small, smooth stone, no larger than a walnut. “Take this. It will show you what you must see.”

Lila hesitated, then took the stone from him. The moment her fingers brushed it, the world around them seemed to ripple, as if the very air had been disturbed. The river’s glow intensified, and suddenly, they were no longer standing in the underground chamber but in a vast, cavernous space, its walls lined with towering pillars carved with the same symbols they’d seen before. At the center of the chamber stood a figure—no, not a figure, but a *presence*—a being of light and shadow, its form shifting like smoke. It was the river’s guardian, they realized. And it was speaking to them.

“We are the last of the old ones,” the guardian said, its voice echoing through the chamber. “We have watched over this place for as long as memory holds. But the world above has forgotten. And when memory fades, so too does the balance.” It turned its gaze to Elias. “You carry something within you, boy. Something that was meant to be hidden. And now, it must be revealed.”

Elias’s hands trembled. He had spent his life feeling like an outsider, like he didn’t belong anywhere—not in his family, not at school, not even in his own skin. But the way the guardian looked at him, as if he were something sacred, something rare—it was as if he had finally been seen.

The vision dissolved, and they were back in the underground river, the air thick with the weight of what they had just witnessed. The figure—the keeper—stepped closer, its golden eyes locked onto Elias. “Go,” it said. “But remember what you have seen. And when the time comes, you will return.”

They didn’t argue. They didn’t ask for more. They simply turned and ran, the river’s current whispering around them as they scrambled back through the loose brick and into the damp, familiar confines of the school basement. The world above was the same—rain still fell in steady sheets, the halls echoed with the usual murmur of voices and footsteps—but they knew, now, that it was not the whole of it. There was another world beneath, one that had been waiting for them all along.

As they met up with the others in the schoolyard, Lila’s eyes were wide, her fingers still clutching the strange stone. Jace looked as though he had just seen a ghost, which, in a way, he had. Elias, for the first time in his life, felt something like belonging. It was a strange, fleeting thing, but it was real. And it had come from somewhere deep beneath the earth, where the river still flowed, where the keeper still watched, and where the old ones waited for the day the world above would remember them again.
