The afternoon sun slanted through the branches of the old oak, casting golden patterns on the grass below. Jake wiped sweat from his brow with the back of his hand as he nailed the last plank of the treehouse floor. His best friend, Mia, sat on the edge, kicking her legs like she was ready to jump down at any moment. "This is going to be the best treehouse ever," Jake said, grinning. "Just wait till we’re done."

Mia hesitated, her fingers still clutching the rough wood. "Yeah, but what if someone else wants to use it? We can’t just lock it up."

Jake shrugged. "We’ll make our own rules. No one else matters."

Mia’s voice turned firm. "But that’s not fair. What if Leo wants to come over? He’s our friend too."

Leo, who had been quietly hammering in the background, looked up. "I was gonna ask if I could help with the ladder. You guys gonna let me?"

Jake’s smile faded. "We’ll see."

Mia sighed. "See? That’s exactly why we need rules. If we don’t decide now, we’re gonna fight later."

Leo rubbed his chin. "Maybe we should talk about it before we finish. That way, everyone feels included."

Jake crossed his arms. "Fine. But I’m still in charge."

Mia rolled her eyes. "You’re not the boss of us."

The argument hung in the air like a cloud. The treehouse, half-built, seemed to wait for them to settle things. Leo cleared his throat. "Look, maybe we could take turns. Like, one day Jake and Mia get to use it, then Leo gets a chance. That way, no one feels left out."

Jake scowled. "That’s stupid. It’s our treehouse."

Mia nudged him gently. "But it’s not just ours, is it? Leo’s our friend too."

Jake’s shoulders slumped. "Okay, okay. But we have to pick the rules together."

They sat on the edge of the half-built structure, passing around a piece of chalk. Jake drew a simple circle. "Okay, so who gets to use it first?"

Leo grinned. "I’ll go next. But I promise I’ll let you guys have it after."

Mia smiled. "And we’ll take turns bringing friends over. But only if they follow the rules."

Jake nodded. "And no fighting."

Leo laughed. "No fighting. Deal."

They spent the rest of the afternoon writing the rules on the trunk with the chalk—no climbing without help, no loud noises after dark, and always asking before using the treehouse. As the sun dipped lower, casting long shadows across the grass, Jake looked around at his friends. "You know, this is way better than just building it for ourselves."

Mia nodded. "Because now it’s ours *together*."

Leo clapped his hands. "And now we’ve got a plan for when we want to use it."

The treehouse wasn’t just a place to hang out anymore. It was a promise—a promise that even when they disagreed, they could still find a way to make things right. And as they climbed inside for the first time, the oak branches swaying above them, they knew they’d built something stronger than wood and nails. They’d built friendship.
