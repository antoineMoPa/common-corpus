The night was soft and still as little Mia lay in her cozy bed, her blanket pulled up to her chin. She had just lost her first baby tooth, and it had tumbled out with a little wiggle and a tiny *pop*. Mia held it in her palm, turning it in the dim glow of her bedside lamp. It was small and white, with a tiny chip at the edge where it had broken free. She smiled, remembering how it had wobbled for days, how she’d tickled it with her tongue, and how her mom had promised a visit from the tooth fairy if it fell out.

Mia tucked the tooth carefully into her nightstand drawer, next to her other treasures—a polished pebble from the beach and a pressed daisy. She drifted off to sleep, dreaming of silver wings and a tiny, glowing figure.

When Mia woke the next morning, she rushed to the drawer. Her tooth was gone. She checked under her pillow, but it wasn’t there. Her heart raced. *Had she dreamed the whole thing?* She peeked out her window. The moon still hung low in the sky, though the sun was beginning to peek over the trees. Maybe the tooth fairy hadn’t come yet.

Just then, a soft *tap-tap-tapping* sounded at her window. Mia froze. The sound came again—delicate and rhythmic, like tiny feet on glass. She tiptoed to the window and lifted the blind just enough to see. There, perched on the windowsill, was the most beautiful creature she had ever seen. She had silver wings that shimmered like moonlight, and her dress was made of swirling stardust. Her eyes sparkled with kindness, and in her tiny hands, she held Mia’s lost tooth.

The tooth fairy smiled. “Good morning, Mia,” she said in a voice like wind chimes. “I saw your tooth waiting for me last night.” She held it up, turning it gently. “It’s so small and brave. It did a wonderful job protecting your smile.”

Mia’s eyes widened. “You’re the tooth fairy!”

The fairy nodded. “And you’re the one who lost a tooth so carefully. I love that.” She placed the tooth on Mia’s palm. “I’ll leave you a little something in return.” With a flick of her wrist, a single silver coin appeared under Mia’s pillow.

Mia gasped. “A quarter! Thank you!” She hugged the fairy’s hand, though the fairy’s fingers were cool and delicate, like petals.

The tooth fairy tilted her head. “You know, Mia, teeth are more than just for smiling. They help us eat, talk, and even keep our faces the way they are. Your tooth worked hard, and that’s why it was so special.”

Mia thought about this. She had always just thought of her teeth as tools, but the fairy made them seem like something more. “So… what’s the lesson?” she asked.

The fairy’s smile softened. “The lesson is that even the smallest things—like a tiny tooth—can do big things. And when something in your body changes, like losing a tooth, it’s not just an ending. It’s a new beginning. Your teeth will grow back, and you’ll take care of them even better now, won’t you?”

Mia nodded eagerly. “Yes! I’ll brush twice a day and floss, just like Mom says.”

The fairy chuckled. “That’s my girl.” She pressed the silver coin into Mia’s hand one last time. “And remember, every time something leaves your body—like a tooth, a hair, or even a sad feeling—it’s okay to let it go. But it doesn’t mean you’re not still you. You grow and change, and that’s how life works.”

With one last wave of her wing, the tooth fairy vanished into the morning light, leaving Mia standing by her window, her heart full. She picked up the quarter and tucked it into her piggy bank, then ran to her bathroom to brush her teeth with extra care. As she splashed water on her face, she grinned—her new tooth was already pushing its way through her gums, ready to take its place. Life, she thought, was full of little adventures, and she was ready for them all.
