The first night without the glow of notifications was the hardest. Elias woke at three-thirty, the kind of hour that had once been a refuge from the relentless hum of the world, but now felt like a betrayal. He lay in the dark, fingers hovering over the nightstand where his phone usually rested, its screen dead now, the battery drained by a week’s worth of disuse. The silence was not the quiet of absence, but the absence of a voice—his own, really, the one he’d learned to shape through likes, through the careful curation of his digital persona. He thought of the last time he’d spoken to his mother, not in person, but through a comment on a photo she’d posted of her garden, the way he’d hesitated before typing *So beautiful, Mom*, the way she’d replied with a string of emojis that felt like a shrug. He’d never told her he was struggling, never once unloaded the weight of his anxiety onto her shoulder, only onto the endless scroll.

The next morning, he found himself standing in the kitchen, coffee brewing, the steam curling into the air like a confession. His neighbor, Mrs. Calloway, had been waving from her porch for three days now, but he’d ignored her, too busy pretending the world outside his apartment wasn’t happening. She’d finally knocked, her knuckles firm against the wood, her face lined with the kind of patience that only comes from decades of living beside people you don’t know well enough to hate. “You look like hell,” she said, stepping inside without waiting for an invitation. “And that’s saying something, because you always look like hell.” Elias laughed, a sharp, unsteady sound. “I’m fine,” he lied. “Just… detoxing.” She raised an eyebrow. “From what?” “Social media,” he admitted. “Oh.” She studied him for a long moment, then pulled a jar of jam from her pocket. “I made this last summer. You take it.” He took it, the weight of it in his palm strange, real. “You’re not the only one who notices you’re gone,” she said. “Your girlfriend called me.” His stomach twisted. “Lena?” “Yeah. She said you haven’t answered her texts for a week.” He swallowed. “I didn’t know she’d ask.” Mrs. Calloway sighed, as if this were the most obvious thing in the world. “People ask. You don’t always answer.” The words settled between them like a stone. He knew it was true. He’d spent years perfecting the art of being reachable—just enough to keep the relationship alive, just enough to avoid the kind of confrontation that might force him to actually *care*. But now, with the buffer gone, the silence between them felt like a chasm. He thought of Lena’s last message: *We should talk.* He’d stared at it for hours, then typed a reply that was half apology, half deflection, and sent it without reading it. He’d never sent it.

By the third day, the absence of social media wasn’t just the absence of a screen—it was the absence of a way to avoid himself. He walked to the park, the same route he took every morning, but this time, he noticed the way the light hit the leaves, the way the wind carried the scent of damp earth. He sat on a bench and watched a woman feed breadcrumbs to ducks, her fingers moving with the same precision as when she scrolled through Instagram, only now, she was feeding them to real ducks, not to an algorithm. He thought about how he’d spent years feeding crumbs to people online, crumbs that were never enough, never real. He pulled out his phone—just to check the time—and saw a notification from a group chat with his old college friends. *Anyone up for drinks tonight?* He hadn’t been to a bar in months, not since that night with Jake, when they’d gotten into an argument about politics, and he’d stormed out, his phone still in his hand, the conversation still open. He’d never closed it. He thought about calling Jake, but the thought of hearing his voice, of having to explain why he’d disappeared, was too much. Instead, he walked back home, his steps heavier with each block.

On the fourth day, he received a call. It was his father. Elias had long since stopped answering calls from him, the last one ending in a scream from his father’s end of the line, a string of accusations that had left Elias shaking. But now, the phone rang in his hand, and he answered. “Dad,” he said, his voice raw. “I haven’t been well.” There was a pause. Then, quietly: “I know.” The words hung between them, heavier than any silence he’d ever experienced online. “I miss you,” his father said. Elias closed his eyes. “I miss you too.” It was the first time he’d said it in years. The next morning, he found a letter on his doorstep. His father had written it by hand, the paper yellowed with age, the ink smudged in places. *I’m proud of you, son. Even when you’re not proud of yourself.* He read it three times, then folded it carefully and put it in his pocket.

The fifth day was the hardest. He woke up to a text from Lena: *I’m at the café near your place. If you want to talk, I’ll be there for an hour.* He sat on the couch, his phone in his hand, the words staring back at him. He thought about all the times he’d avoided her, all the times he’d let the buffer of social media, of work, of anything, stand between them. He thought about how much easier it was to argue online, to ghost, to pretend. But now, here she was, waiting for him, real and present, and he had to decide: was he going to run, or was he going to face her? He stood up, his legs unsteady, and walked to the café. She was sitting at a table by the window, her coffee untouched. She looked up as he approached, her eyes tired but steady. “Hi,” she said. “You came.” “I had to,” he admitted. She reached across the table and took his hand. “I’m sorry,” he said. “For not answering. For not being there.” She squeezed his hand. “I’m sorry too,” she said. “For not saying things when they mattered.” They sat in silence for a moment, the weight of their unspoken words between them. Then she said, “We can’t keep doing this, Elias. We can’t keep avoiding each other.” He nodded. “I know.” They spent the next hour talking—not about the past, not about the mistakes, but about the future. About the real future, not the one they’d imagined through likes and comments. About the future where they had to actually *show up*.

By the sixth day, Elias felt lighter. He walked to the park again, this time with a purpose. He sat on the same bench and watched the ducks, but now, he fed them breadcrumbs with his own hands. He thought about how much easier it was to feed them online, to pretend to care, to pretend to be present. But now, he was here, in the real world, with real ducks, and real people. He thought about his father’s letter, about Lena’s patience, about Mrs. Calloway’s jam. He thought about how much he’d spent his life avoiding confrontation, avoiding real relationships, avoiding himself. But now, he was here, and he was going to face it. He was going to face the real world, with all its mess and its beauty, and he was going to be present.

On the seventh day, he posted a single photo on Instagram—a picture of him feeding the ducks, the sky above him a clear blue. He didn’t tag anyone. He didn’t write a caption. He just posted it, and then he deleted the app from his phone. He didn’t look back. He didn’t need to. He was here, in the real world, and he was going to stay.
